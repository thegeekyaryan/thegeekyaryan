<p class="p-3">I also write blogs, normally about my projects to give a lot more background information about the thoughts, process and choices went into the project. Or a tutorial about something interesting I figured out to code or make. Also on thoughts and perspectives that matter to me and had something to share.

    I also make podcast on many thing related to technology and explain them very beautifully

I have designed almost all of my websites using a vast amount of HTML. HTML as a language acts as my support system.</p>

        Designing has always been my forte, since childhood I used to design logos, letterheads and what not. As websites and digital designing came into my life, HTML wasn't enough to create my way of beautiful websites, hence I started to learn CSS. It's been more than four years now since I had first used it</p>
